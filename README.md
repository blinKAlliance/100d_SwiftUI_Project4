# Better Rest
This app is designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:

- When do they want to wake up?
- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?


Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed. Project guidelines were recieved inside the 100 Days of SwiftUI Course located here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui (Day 26)
